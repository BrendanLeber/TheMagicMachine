# The Magic Machine

My implementations of programs from the A.K. Dewdney books "The Magic Machine,"
and "The Tinkertoy Computer."

## Motivation

I want to learn [Processing](https://processing.org) to implement some
ideas I've had.  So I've taken some of my early graphical toys when I
was learning programming and converted them to Processing.

Some of the ideas and algorithms come from the books "The Magic
Machine" and "The Tinkertoy Computer" by
[A.K. Dewdney](http://www.csd.uwo.ca/faculty/akd/akd.html).

## The Books

### The Magic Machine: A Handbook of Computer Sorcery.

Author: A.K. Dewdney
Publisher: W.H. Freeman

### The Tinkertoy Computer

## Programs

### AlgorithmicArt

My first Processing project.  A simple program that draws rectangles
that shift colors.  You can see an example of this in a video on
[YouTube](https://youtu.be/2BtyXq71O7M).

### Slow Growths

An implementation of the Slow Growths algorithm in Chapter 8 of
[A.K. Dewdney](http://www.csd.uwo.ca/faculty/akd/akd.html)'s book "The
Magic Machine."

### Turmites

An animated 2-dimensional Turing machine.

### Bouncing Spots

A simple animation of bouncing spots.

### Mandlebrot Magic

TBD
